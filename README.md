# chess

This was a project I had created right upon entering college. I created this to give myself a head start in various programming data structures and to learn pointer arithmetic. Essentially, I wanted a manageable challenge. I learned mostly how to print debug and ifdef debugging since I didn't have access to visual studio debugging tools at this time.
